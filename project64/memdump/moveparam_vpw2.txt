freem presents:
virtual pro-wrestling 2 lazy moves and parameters dumper
for project64 2.4.x or later, as long as you have debugging tools enabled
=========================================================================
ok look I'm in a rush here because I'm happy this works, so the gory details
are later in the document. here's the quick runthrough.

this archive contains 3 files.
one of them is this text file.

memdump.js is a generic memory dumper for project64.

moveparam_vpw2.html is an interface for dumping vpw2 moves and parameters,
which uses the above memdump.js to do the dirty work.

okay, that's out of the way, I hope.

[INSTALLATION]
1) create a Scripts folder where Project64.exe lives.
2) extract memdump.js to the scripts folder.
3) put moveparam_vpw2.html wherever you want.

[USAGE]
1) open project64
2) load vpw2
3) start a match with the wrestlers you want to dump data for
4) go to debugger > scripts
5) either double click on memdump.js, or right click memdump.js and choose run
6) open memdump.html in a browser and click links to "download" moves and param data.

awesome, now I don't need to keep writing the same addresses over and over again!

[DETAILS ON MEMDUMP]
memdump.js is a script for Project64 that allows for simple memory dumping.
"Why not use the Dump Memory window?" you might ask... I got tired of writing
the same start and ending addresses in the boxes. Unlike the Dump Memory window,
memdump does not support using an alternate PC (program counter), so if you need
that functionality, this isn't a replacement for you.

usage, the short version:
"start" - memory dump start address
"end"   - memory dump end address
"filename" (optional) - filename to dump data to (defaults to "output.bin")
ONLY USE HEX ADDRESSES OR I'LL PUNCH YA

e.g. http://localhost/?start=80000000&end=80000040&filename=dump.bin

[QUESTION THING]
"what happens if I make the start address larger than the end address?"
don't do that.

"how do I expand this to work for [x game]?"
copy the html file, edit the start and end addresses, and uh...
maybe change the layout if you're not hacking an AKI wrestling game.
